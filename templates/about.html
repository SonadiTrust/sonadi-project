          Founded in 2001 under the visionary leadership of Mrs. Bandana
          Sengupta and Dr. Vijay Kumar,
          <strong>Sonadi Charitable Trust</strong> began its journey in
          Chittaranjan Park, New Delhi, with a single mission — to bring
          compassionate care to the lives of voiceless animals.

        <p>
          From modest beginnings, Sonadi has grown into a leading shelter and
          treatment facility for injured, abandoned, and mistreated street
          animals. With unwavering commitment, our veterinarians, para-vets,
          caretakers, and volunteers have transformed thousands of lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          Key programs include the
          <strong>Animal Birth Control Program</strong>, aimed at reducing
          human-animal conflict, controlling population, and eliminating rabies.
          We run a state-of-the-art unit for sterilization surgeries on dogs and
          cats, ensuring quality post-op care.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Rescue operations</strong> are powered by medical ambulances
          for ill or abandoned animals. We also conduct
          <strong>anti-rabies vaccination drives</strong>, in collaboration with
          community groups and local volunteers.

        <p>
          So far, Sonadi has successfully performed over
          <strong>2 Lakh ABC surgeries</strong>, treated countless animals, and
          provided lifelong shelter to many who can no longer survive on the
          streets.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Sonadi, our vision is to create a future where
          <em>no animal suffers alone</em>. We aim to build a compassionate
          medical facility that ensures healing with dignity and love.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through adoption campaigns, awareness drives, and community outreach,
          we’re building a culture of compassion — one paw at a time.
